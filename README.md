# Particle Swarm Optimization

Simple implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm written in python3. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity.

## Usage

- Install dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy
```

- Tweak constants in `pso.py`, fitness function, number of iterations etc.
- Run

```python
python pso.py
```
